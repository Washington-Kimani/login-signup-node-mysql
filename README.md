This app is a simple login sytem made using:
-node
-express
-mysql
-ejs
-bcrypt -for password hashing. Means that passwords are not saved into database as plain text.

to run the project, 
1. Clone repo,
2. run npm install,
3. create a .env file and include the process environment variables
4. run npm start



Have fun messing around with the code👌. The database.js has a delete function that I did not implement. You can do that. ✌️
